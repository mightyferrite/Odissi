Reviving lost Native American Languages

App that lists phrases.. when selected it will playback that phrase.  Currently just one language, hopefully we will add 
more.

Translations + Playback provided by Bruce Nevin who has spent over 30 years documenting this language, originally as his PHD thesis.  This is actively being used by members of the tribe to help reclaim their lost language.

This is made in xamerin and can compile and run on Android and IOS.
